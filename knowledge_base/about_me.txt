Iâ€™m Satyam Sharma, a curious and dedicated Python developer with over 1 year of professional experience, driven by a passion for building intelligent systems using large language models (LLMs) and integrating AI into real-world applications. I love turning innovative ideas into impactful solutions, particularly by leveraging cutting-edge tools such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), FastAPI, vector databases, and gRPC microservices. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Agra, where I graduated in 2021 with a CGPA of 7.3.
