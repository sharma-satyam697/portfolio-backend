I built a context-aware personal assistant that manages 20–50 user-specific collections for queries related to mental well-being, relationships, career, and more. This assistant uses GPT-4.1 Nano API to semantically route questions to the right collection, enabling precise answers. It also stores each query's embedding with a timestamp, allowing for continuous self-improvement and better future recommendations. I’m currently working on integrating this assistant with the Twilio WhatsApp API to support real-time and multi-context conversations.
