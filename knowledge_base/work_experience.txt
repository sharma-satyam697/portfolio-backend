I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at Coretus Technology in Rajkot (since April 2024). At Coretus, I’ve had the opportunity to design and build LLM-based solutions, including a fully functional RAG chatbot using Hugging Face models, Qdrant, and Mistral 7B. I’ve also developed a robust stock market prediction system using LSTM and RNN techniques on 12+ years of Nifty and Bank Nifty data, alongside time series data modeling with InfluxDB. As part of the team behind the EAT application, I contributed to delivering personalized recipe recommendations using AI, which significantly improved user engagement. I’ve also worked on implementing and maintaining microservices using both REST APIs and gRPC architecture.
